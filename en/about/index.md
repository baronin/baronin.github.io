# About me
Hi friends, my name is Yaroslav and I love the frontend.

I live in Ukraine.

My first steps started in 2016, I passed a course on front-end development.

In 2017, I had my first remote job, a markup for online shops.

In 2018, I settled into a web studio where I worked for 3 months and went to courses at the very cool company Altexsoft.

At the end of 2018 I finished my courses, internships and started working at this company. Worked before the COVID-19 pandemic. I learned a lot there, for which I thank you very much.
And now I can work on your project with excellent experience in working with an IT company.

Here is my little story :)
I wish all the rays good and positive!
Best regards baronin.pro.
